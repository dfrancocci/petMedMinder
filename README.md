# Pet Med Minder

Pet Med Minder is a custom Alexa skill which is designed to help you remember when you last gave your pet her medicine, so that you know when her next medicine is due.

This is particularly useful for things like flea treatments for cats and dogs, where they have to be given each month, but it's easy to forget when you last did it unless you record it at the time. 
Pet Med Minder can be invoked when you give your pet her medicine, for example:

"Alexa, I just gave my cat her flea treatment".

Pet Med Minder will acknowledge that it's recorded the treatment:

"OK, I got that you gave your cat flea treatment on Fri Dec 07 2018".

Later on, if you launch Pet Med Minder, it will read out the last treatment it has a record of:

"You last gave your cat flea treatment on Fri Dec 07 2018".
