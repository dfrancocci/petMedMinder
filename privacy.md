Pet Med Minder is intended to help you remember when you gave your pet a treatment. 

To enable it to work, it records the following details on a database:

- The type of pet - e.g. cat, dog, spider monkey
- The treatment - e.g. 'flea treatment', 'Advocat'
- The date of the treatment

These details are persisted on the database under your user ID, and are used when you query Pet Med Minder later on to check your details. 

The details are not available to any other users.
